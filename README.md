## What I've Done So Far
- Deployed and configured nginx web server
- Configured UFW firewall rules and tested with nmap
- Set up SSH and tested authentication logging
- Simulated basic incident response by terminating an active SSH session
- Diagnosed and resolved network issues on Ubuntu and Kali Linux VMs
- Built a virtualized network with pfSense, with LAN + DMZ segmentation
- Troubleshot connectivity problems stemming from routing, DHCP, firewall, and system issues
- Deployed Wazuh SIEM on a new Ubuntu VM and verified installation

## In Progress
Connecting Ubuntu server to Wazuh and testing that logs and alerts work properly
